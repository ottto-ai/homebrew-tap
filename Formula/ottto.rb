      Start the Ottto local service:
        brew services start ottto

      Check status after the service is started:
        ottto --no-autostart status --json

      Update this Homebrew-managed install:
        brew update && brew upgrade ottto
        brew services restart ottto

      Stop and uninstall:
        brew services stop ottto
        brew uninstall ottto

      The Homebrew service owns launchd label net.ottto.service and the default
      per-user socket at ~/Library/Application Support/Ottto/ottto-service.sock.
      If Ottto.app is also installed, leave service lifecycle with Homebrew; the
      app connects to the Homebrew-owned service instead of replacing it.
